    <center><h1>My time at Dance4Healing</h1></center>
    <center><h2>Time Spent: 6 months (June 2021-January 2022)</h2></center>
    <center><p> Overall, my time at Dance4Healing was really fun. This was my first ever internhsip experience and I have learned so much from my time here.
        I started out my time at D4H by taking some training courses from CodeAcademy about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first time using these three in together.
        From these courses, I learned how to structure, style, and even add some basic functionality to a website. I remember the first basic project that I did with these three was a to-do list application.
        Fortunately, I dont have acess to it anymore, but lets just say that it was not the best. After completing the training, I finally began to work on the website with great people. I was tasked with social media login of the website.
        This was most certainly a challenge because I quickly figured out that being able to do some basic structring and styling doesnt mean I can automatically contribute to a code base. However after a month, I figured it out.
        I got to learn about APIs and how they are used in website. I ended up using the Firebase Javascript SDK to set up the functionality and with the help of my fellow interns, we were able to manually control the flow of the login.
        After I finished the social media login page, I decided it was time for me to leave the internship as I had to go and focus on different things. I really enjoyed this experience and want to thank my amazing co-interns and my leaders throughout.
        I want to give a huge thanks to Amy Li and Rez Khan for guiding me throughout the internship and helping me understand the basics of web development. I am excited for future opprotunities!
